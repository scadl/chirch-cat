# ChirchCat
This is very intersting webmodule. So, in root, this is plain places catalog (orthodox chirches in particular), where each of them has photo-icon, some description (loaded from wp static page), two of maps (from google and yandex), and small table, showing the open hours of this places.

### To make it functional 
* add my 'chirch' table to your WordPress database, 
* adjust my dbconfig.php varaibles to suit your db setup

Currently there no way to add and remove the POI itself, but you can edit them with builtin CP, changing, it's titles, photos, table, maps and so on. If ther to many of them for you, remove rows from my table, or add them if needed. Or may be you can improve my cp with POI mangment?...
